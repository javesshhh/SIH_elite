Stem cell transplant
But we need awareness
The possibility that you get 100%match is 1 out of 10,000 .
Our population is more than 1.3 billion but only 0.4 million know their hla typing.

                          <br>
                          if your stem cell type is matched with any patient then you will get contacted
                          and if you are comfortable at that time then you will be required to visit nearby hospital. i <br>it just takes 2 to 3 hours
                          you willm be given an injection so that your stem cell starts flowing with your blood to ensure that they don't need to take it directely from your bone marrow.and now blood in which your stem cells are present will be taken.
